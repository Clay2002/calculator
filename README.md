# calculator
Just making a very baisc calculator

first update:

  Added a lot of button like numbers 1-9 and all the * / + - buttons with 2 inputs a delete button and enter.
I got the delete button to work when you press it. It deletes all the values that are in the both of the input element. 
I also added an eventlistener to add a value to the input value when you click any of the numbers. This will but the button number you clicked into the input and the delete button works with that which is a good start.

Second update:

  Still did add any css. I will once I am finsihed or get really stuck on something. This update I got it to display an output of the 2 numbers you picked. The buttons only work for the first input and you need to click onto the input element to enter a number which I need to fix. I also added and messed around for the first time ever with arrays. I have the first input and second input set to an empty array. This array will take both of the value in both of the input elements and will do the math. Having a hard time trying to make it do the other operations like - * by clicking the button. Once I get that working I will be very close to finsihing the project.

Third update:

  Got everything working. I had to think outside to box and made an if statment connected with a onlick button which would change if you click the operater. This would do the math by the inner html. Also started to add some css grid. Ive been stuggling to put 2 inputs on the sameline for the pass 20 mins. The css is almost done and all I need to do after that is fix somethings. I need to add and fix a lot of things but it shouldnt take me more than 2 hours to do so. After that the porject will be done and I will move on with my javascript learning and starting another project!
