# calculator
Just making a very baisc calculator

first update:

  Added a lot of button like numbers 1-9 and all the * / + - buttons with 2 inputs a delete button and enter.
I got the delete button to work when you press it. It deletes all the values that are in the both of the input element. 
I also added an eventlistener to add a value to the input value when you click any of the numbers. This will but the button number you clicked into the input and the delete button works with that which is a good start.
